    "Welcome to Dialektli!",
    "Dialektli was created to celebrate and share the vibrant spectrum of Swiss expressions, words, and idioms, Dialektli aims to provide a platform for celebrating and sharing the diverse range of Swiss expressions, words, and idioms.",
    "Inspired by the spirit of community-driven platforms like <0 href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/'>Urban Dictionary</0>, Dialektli embraces the grassroots nature of language evolution. Users contribute their own unique expressions, anecdotes, and linguistic insights. Our platform draws inspiration from the meticulous documentation efforts of sites like <0 href='https://www.idiotikon.ch/'>Schweizerisches Idiotikon</0> and <0 href='https://sdats.ch/'>Swiss Dialects Atlas Project</0>, which have long been dedicated to cataloguing and preserving Swiss dialects and linguistic heritage.",
    "Dialektli combines the best of both worlds by providing a dynamic and interactive space for users to contribute, explore, and engage with Swiss language and culture. Whether you're interested in uncovering the origins of a particular Swiss-German phrase, sharing a beloved regional expression, or immersing yourself in the rich linguistic landscape of Switzerland, Dialektli is the perfect platform for linguistic enthusiasts and cultural aficionados alike.",
    "Our motivation stems from a deep understanding of the importance of written language in preserving cultural heritage and linguistic diversity. We recognize that a language that remains solely oral risks fading into obscurity over time. By providing a platform where Swiss expressions, words, and idioms can be documented and shared in written form, we aim to safeguard not only the words themselves but also the ideas, cultural nuances, and ways of thinking embedded within them.",
    "The significance of having a written form for a language cannot be overstated. Writing serves as a vital tool for the preservation and transmission of language across generations. It allows for the recording of historical events, traditions, and cultural practices, providing a tangible link to the past for future generations to explore and understand. Additionally, writing facilitates communication beyond geographical boundaries, enabling speakers of the language to connect and interact across different regions and communities.",
    "Furthermore, having a written form for a language contributes to its prestige and recognition, both nationally and internationally. It opens up opportunities for literature, education, and scholarly research, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of the language's rich linguistic heritage.",
    "By encouraging users to contribute to Dialektli's growing repository of Swiss expressions and idioms, we empower individuals to play an active role in the preservation and promotion of their linguistic heritage. Together, we can ensure that Swiss languages and dialects continue to thrive, not just in spoken form, but also in written form, preserving their beauty and diversity for generations to come.",
    "Finally, we extend our heartfelt gratitude to all our users and contributors, (Panter AG, M. Ruepp, M. Wettstein, R. Gulla, I. Peterkovsky, R. Aeschbacher) who have helped shape Dialektli into the vibrant community it aims to be. Your passion for Swiss language and culture fuels our motivation to continue expanding and enriching our platform. Thank you for your ongoing support and dedication to preserving and celebrating the linguistic heritage of Switzerland.",
    "Join us in celebrating the beauty and diversity of Swiss language and culture. Let's continue to preserve, share, and celebrate the unique expressions and idioms that make Swiss language.",
